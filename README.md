# ðŸ““ Annotate

Easily compile your notes in markdown into static web pages. You can then deploy these static pages to your host of choice such as GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.

## Features

- Automatic LaTex support (`$` for inline, `$$$` for multi-line)
- Table of Contents
- Instant compilation
- Easy deployment
- Development mode (serve your HTML websites automatically using `annotate serve`)
  - HMR (hot module replacement) coming soon

## Installation

Installation of this is quite simple. You can clone the source code and run it. Or, if you prefer a CLI tool, you can install `annotate` from npm.

```bash
npm install -g @atomdevelops/annotate
```

Once you've installed `annotate`, you can use it in your terminal.

```
annotate --help
```
